Probality:

     If two coins are tossed,  S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.

     In rolling a dice,  S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Probability of Occurrence of an Event:

 P(E) =	n(E)
        n(S)

Results on Probability:

        P(S) = 1
        
        0<P(E)<1
        
        P() = 0

For any events A and B we have : P(A  B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A  B)

If A denotes (not-A), then P(A) = 1 - P(A).
